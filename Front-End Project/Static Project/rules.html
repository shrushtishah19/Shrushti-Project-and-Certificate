<ol><b></b>
<li><b>Feed kids immediately :</b><br> As every parent knows, when a child’s blood sugar level gets too low, they become irritable. It happens to adults too but children can be particularly susceptible and can’t always articulate how they are feeling.  The solution is simple. Give them something  almost anything to eat right away.</li><br>

<li><b>Don’t clear dishes until the customer is really finished with them :</b><br>My biggest irritation at restaurants is when the waiter whisks away my dish or glass when it isn’t 100% empty. And even if it is, I think it would be courteous for them to ask before they remove it.  I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had a waiter take away a plate when there was still food on it.</li><br>

<li><b>Bring water as soon as the customer asks :</b><br>
If a customer asks for water it’s probably because they are thirsty.  Don’t make them wait a long time for it.  Bring it right away. And don’t bring the beer or soft drinks ahead of the water just because they’re sold rather than given away.</li><br>

<li><b>Be attentive but not annoying :</b><br>
Waiters and other servers are there to serve customers, not annoy them.  I don’t know what’s worse — needing service and not finding anyone nearby to help you or trying to have a conversation with a dining mate and being constantly interrupted by the waiter.</li><br>

<li><b>Seat parties as people arrive:</b><br>
I realize there may have to be exceptions to this but, as a general rule, don’t insist on the entire party arriving before seating people. If someone gets there a little early or someone is a bit late, it’s nice to be able to sit at the table and wait or maybe even have a drink or an appetizer while waiting. If the restaurant is very crowded, it might make more sense to have the person wait, but don’t make them unless it’s really necessary.</li><br>

<li><b>Don’t make people wait forever for their check, credit card or change :</b><br>
I can think of times when I was tempted to walk out of a restaurant without paying because it took me forever to get my check. While you don’t want to rush your customers by shoving a check in front of them too soon, you don’t want them to have to get up from the table and demand the check as I’ve had to do when I’m in a hurry.</li><br>
